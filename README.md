# Universal Genetic Algorithm

## Project Goals
1. Improve on existing python libraries in the same domain
1. Build a platform that can accomidate a wide variety of genetic algorithms
1. Create tools for the most common and straightforward types of genetic algorithm

## Basic Functionality
Provide a basic template to handle the most common tasks in creating and using a GA, so that users can focus on algorithm creation and utilization. 

## How to Install and Use
### Installation
TODO
### Use
- The BGA project is divided up into the following subsections:
    - selectors
    - genetic_operators
    - generators
    - transcriptors
    - algorithms
    - fitness_functions 
- Each BGA subsection contains a collection of code relating to a specific algorithm or step in that algorithm. 
- The contents of a subsection are divided up by how they behave. 
- It is possible to implement a simple genetic algorithm without using code from outside of BGA:
    ```
    from bga.selectors.tournament import create_tournament_selector
    from bga.genetic_operators.single_point import create_single_point_mutator, create_single_point_crossover
    from bga.generators import create_int_list_generator
    # a transcriptor will not be necessary here, see bga/transcriptors/docs for more information
    from bga.algorithms import create_simple_mutator_algorithm
    from bga.fitness_functions import create_literal_fitness_function

    select = create_tournament_selector(size=3)
    generate = create_int_list_generator(size=4, min=1, max=5)
    cross = create_single_point_crossover(mask_size=4)
    mutate = create_single_point_mutator(cross, generate)
    fitness_func = create_literal_fitness_function(seq=[1, 2, 3, 4])

    algo = create_simple_mutator_algorithm(
        selector=select,
        generator=generate,
        mutator=mutate,
        fitness_function=fitness_funct
    )

    results = algo(iterations=100)

    print(results["best"])
    ```
- Any of these functions can be replaced by user-defined alternatives. Make sure to navigate to the relevent subsection and follow the guidlines in docs/implementation_guidlines.md (ex. the guidlines for making a selector can be found by following the path uga/selector/docs/implementation_guidlines.md)
